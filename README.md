# Machine-Learning-Package

This repository consists of three datasets-
  1. Iris Dataset
  2. Optical Hand Writing Recognition Dataset
  3. Wine Recognition Dataset

Four machine learning models have been applied to each one of the dataset. The machine learning models are - 
  1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
  2. Logistic Regression Model
  3. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
  4. Decision Tree
  
Accuracy of all the models are calculated and shown. I have also applied Cross-Validation on these and score is also shown. At the end, Stacking-based ensemble learning has been implemented using all 4 machine learning models.
